# RRTMM - Russian Real Time Mini Map

The idea of a real life mini map, that consists of marking the target, requesting the coordinates and cooping the ground troops or heavy armor with drone operators.

1. Request a real-time position via satellite.
2. Mark a target.
3. Calculate a distance from the drone to the mark and locate the target on screen.
4. Transmit the data to other users.

Ground troops have to use special tablets to get information about marks in real time.
